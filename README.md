# German Credit Risk Modeling

## Overview
This project focuses on **credit risk classification** using the German Credit dataset, aiming to predict whether a customer represents **good or bad credit risk**. The workflow emphasizes **data preprocessing, feature handling, and risk-focused evaluation**, reflecting real-world lending scenarios.

## What This Project Covers
- Credit risk data exploration and preprocessing  
- Handling categorical and numerical financial features  
- Baseline vs machine learning model comparison  
- Risk-sensitive evaluation metrics  

## Pipeline
1. Data loading and inspection  
2. Data cleaning and preprocessing  
3. Encoding categorical variables  
4. Feature scaling  
5. Train / test split  
6. Baseline model training  
7. Advanced model training  
8. Model evaluation and comparison  

## Tools & Tech
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  

## Evaluation Focus
- Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score  
- Emphasis on **misclassification of bad credit risk**  
- Understanding trade-offs relevant to lending decisions  

## Notes
This project is designed to mirror **practical credit risk modeling**, where model decisions directly impact financial loss and approval quality.
